# Tier 3 Stage 1: frequency-response reserve frontier

## Purpose
Tier 3 asks the battery to connect market behaviour to grid frequency. This first stage
implements the market-side part: the arbitrage optimiser can reserve upward discharge
capacity for frequency response, then quantify how much arbitrage profit is sacrificed.

This is not yet the full mode-switching supervisor. It is the availability frontier that
the supervisor would trade against.

## Method
The battery LP now accepts two optional reserve constraints:

- `reserve_power_kw`: keep this much upward discharge headroom every hour.
- `reserve_energy_kwh`: keep enough stored energy to sustain the reserve for a chosen
  duration.

For the current experiment, the sustain duration is 30 minutes:

```text
reserve_energy_kwh = reserve_power_kw * 0.5 h / eta_dis
```

The sweep uses perfect-foresight prices deliberately. That isolates the price of the
reserve constraint from Tier 2 forecast error.

## Result

| reserve | power | energy floor | profit | profit kept |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0% | 0 kW | 0.0 kWh | GBP 16,176 | 100.0% |
| 20% | 200 kW | 106.6 kWh | GBP 14,184 | 87.7% |
| 50% | 500 kW | 266.5 kWh | GBP 10,807 | 66.8% |
| 80% | 800 kW | 426.4 kWh | GBP 6,986 | 43.2% |
| 100% | 1000 kW | 533.0 kWh | GBP 0 | 0.0% |

The curve is convex: low reserve levels are relatively cheap, while the final slices of
reserve remove the power needed for the most valuable arbitrage trades.

## Interpretation
Reserving 200 kW for frequency response costs about GBP 1,992 over 60 days, or 12.3% of
the perfect-foresight arbitrage value. Reserving 500 kW keeps about two thirds of the
arbitrage profit while guaranteeing half the battery rating as upward response for
30 minutes.

## Limitations
- This is an availability constraint, not yet a live low-frequency dispatch controller.
- The sweep uses perfect foresight to isolate the reserve cost; realistic forecast-based
  operation would sit lower in absolute profit.
- The battery is the original 1 MW / 2 MWh asset. A visible system-frequency impact would
  require scaling to an aggregated fleet or explicitly reporting per-MW impact.
